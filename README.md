# Tool-Centre-Point-Camera

Camera mount designed to have an unobstructed side view to inspect and correct the Tool Centre Point (TCP) of the robot's end-of-arm tool during the pick operation. The goal of this project was to correct the tool in the case of incorrect alignment during the pick operation.

The main constrain for the part was the risk of collisions during production recipe. Previous design caused collisions during edge cases of robot move. The camera mount was updated to solve this issue as well as add more stiffness to the part to ensure image quality. The mounting mechanism was also updated with edge registration to ensure repeatability and ease of placement of the camera mount.
